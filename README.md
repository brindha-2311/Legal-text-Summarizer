# Legal-text-Summarizer

This project implements abstractive text summarization using the T5-base Transformer model on the BillSum dataset.
The model is trained and fine-tuned to generate concise summaries of long legal or legislative texts while maintaining coherence and factual consistency.
Evaluation is performed using ROUGE metrics, and the model demonstrates effective summarization performance for complex document structures.
